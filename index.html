                                Great to meet you! My name is Dana and I am a web developer based in Austin, TX! Building websites has been a dream of mine for so long and I am very excited that I get to live my dream.<br><br>
                                Coding for me has always been a fun challenge! My first line of code I performed was as a little kid on a Nickelodeon forum where they were showing kids how to change the color of their text. I convinced my step father that I <strong>NEEDED</strong> to change my font color to pink and he helped me!
                                After that, I didn't do much coding until I got to high school and this really awesome website was created called MySpace. I spent hours making sure that I made my MySpace layout as <em>flashy</em> as possible.<br><br>
                                Fast forward to 2018, I was talking to some friends of mine who are developers and they began talking about MySpace. Instantly, I felt <em>nostalgia</em> and wondered why I ever stopped coding! I went home that night and began learning about HTML and CSS and sparked my passion once more. Once I started, I didn't want to stop and decided to pursue coding for my career since I love it so much!<br><br>
                                This year, I took the jump and I am very pleased to announce that after some time setting goals and planning, I am currently a Full-Time student at the University of Texas' Web Development Boot Camp pursuing my dream!
